# OpenDataDiscovery.org

Currently working in progress. See the [**demo site**](http://ec2-52-87-229-42.compute-1.amazonaws.com/).

**OpenDataDiscovery.org** is a map of open data portals based on CKAN platforms and their state of data opening. This is a project to gain more understanding of the open world as a whole, not just pieces of it.

## How does it work?

A large number of [governments and organizations](http://ckan.org/instances/#) are using [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) to build their open data portals. As CKAN provides a full set of APIs for data searching, it is possible to build an application to collect information from all CKAN-bases portals.

Specially, we are collecting information about the state of data opening, including

* total number of opened datasets

* popular tags used by datasets

* dataset categories

* organizations that publish datasets

A program is setup to collect this information weekly for each portals. Check this [list](https://github.com/OpenDataDiscovery/OpenDataDiscovery.org/blob/master/portals.md) to see all supported portals.

## Thanks to these awesome people
