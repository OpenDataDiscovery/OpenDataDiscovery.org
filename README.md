# OpenDataDiscovery.org

[**OpenDataDiscovery.org**](http://www.opendatadiscovery.org) is a project to track and delineate the world of open data. It's an effort delineate the world of open data by answering some fundamental questions:

* How many datasets are there?

* What are they about?

* Who are publishing them?

By collecting metadata from more than 1,000 data portals worldwide in a weekly basis, this project is able to gain us more understanding about existing open data and keep track of its development.

## Thanks to these awesome people
